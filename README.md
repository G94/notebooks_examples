# Notebooks Examples
 Some examples from machine learning competitions at kaggle and Driven Data.
 
 
 ## Kaggle Competitions
 This platform offers a free tool for data science teachers to run academic and business machine learning competitions.
 
[PredictFutureSales:1CCompetition, WholeProcess](https://github.com/G94/notebooks_examples/tree/master/Kaggle_competitions/Predict%20Future%20Sales%20-%20Kaggle%20Competition)
 We have to predict the amount of items that would be sold the next month for each shop.

[BBVADataChallenge2018:Preprocessing, baseline models](https://github.com/G94/notebooks_examples/blob/master/Kaggle_competitions/bbvadatachallenge2018_notebook.ipynb)
The aim was to predict a rating of an establishment that would indicate if the user would like to buy sth in this local.

[BanBifDathaton2018:Attrition,baseline model](https://github.com/G94/notebooks_examples/blob/master/Kaggle_competitions/dathatonbanbif_baseline.ipynb)
The target was the probability of a user opening an special type of bank account.


## Driven Data Competitions
[Power Laws:Cold Start Energy Competition](https://github.com/G94/notebooks_examples/blob/master/drivendata_competitions/Cold%20Start%20Energy_EDA.ipynb)
>The predictions are in different period of time, some of them  are weekly and others are daily. The targte if the amount of energy a building would spend in a day or a week.
